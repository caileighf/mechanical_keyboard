# mechanical_keyboard
repo for case files I designed for different mechanical keyboards I've made. Includes files for laser cutting, water jet and, 3D printing.

I have added these file types:
.svg
.dxf
.eps

These are mostly sandwich style cases. 
They are all compatible with 2mm standoff and bolts.

I have found that using the plate only opens up the possibility for a wood case or a 3D printed case. 
(You may also consider 3D printing the plate)

If you have a request for a specific file type let me know via email
caileigh@mit.edu

If you needed to convert the file type and want to submit a pull request with the new kind that would be great! 
I am also happy to merge any design changes or tweaks.
--------------------------
I will be adding more files and keyboards as I go. I have a few 3D files in progress.
